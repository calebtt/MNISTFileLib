# MNISTFileLib
Someone asked for some help on reading MNIST file data, I went slightly overboard. Specifically the IDX3 file format.
Since then, I have added a Feed Forward Neural Network project, it does not yet support back propagation or learning.
It is what I have been able to gather a FFNN implementation might look like, from various sources.
